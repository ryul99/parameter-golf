## Overview

Standard residual connections accumulate all layer outputs with fixed unit weights. As depth grows, this uniform aggregation dilutes each layer's contribution and causes hidden-state magnitudes to grow unboundedly — a well-known problem with PreNorm.

**AttnRes** replaces this fixed accumulation with softmax attention over preceding layer outputs:

$$\mathbf{h}_l = \sum_{i=0}^{l-1} \alpha_{i \to l} \cdot \mathbf{v}_i$$

where the weights $\alpha_{i \to l}$ are computed via a single learned pseudo-query $\mathbf{w}_l \in \mathbb{R}^d$ per layer. This gives every layer selective, content-aware access to all earlier representations.

### Block AttnRes

Full AttnRes is straightforward but requires O(Ld) memory at scale. **Block AttnRes** partitions layers into N blocks, accumulates within each block via standard residuals, and applies attention only over block-level representations. With ~8 blocks, it recovers most of Full AttnRes's gains while serving as a practical drop-in replacement with marginal overhead.
